Webpage Layout and Styling ProjectThis project focuses on building a responsive and modern webpage layout using CSS Flexbox while implementing several specific styling requirements, including edge-to-edge layout and custom table formatting.üéØ Goal & Key FeaturesThe primary goal of this task was to restructure the traditional vertical stacking of HTML elements into a complex, full-height column and row layout using nested Flexbox containers.Layout Structure:The design follows a standard modern application layout:<body> (Outer Container): Uses display: flex and flex-direction: column to stack the header, main content area, and footer vertically. It is set to min-height: 100vh to guarantee the footer always reaches the bottom of the viewport.<main> (Inner Container): Uses display: flex with a default flex-direction: row to place the article and aside elements side-by-side. It uses flex-grow: 1 to fill all available vertical space between the header and footer.<article> (Content Area): Occupies two-thirds (2/3) of the main content width (flex: 2).<aside> (Sidebar): Occupies one-third (1/3) of the main content width (flex: 1).Styling & Resets:Edge-to-Edge Display: A comprehensive universal reset (*, ::before, ::after) was implemented, along with a critical html, body rule that uses !important to force zero margin and padding, ensuring the content touches all edges of the viewport.Header Navigation: Flexbox was applied to the navigation (<nav>) and list (<ul>) to align the logo to the left and push the menu links to the far right.Table Styling: Custom styling was added to the <table> to ensure clear borders, padding, and distinct header backgrounds.Footer Alignment: The footer text is explicitly aligned to the left.Scrolling: Both the <article> and <aside> are set to overflow-y: auto to allow internal scrolling without affecting the overall page layout.üõ†Ô∏è Filesindex.html: Contains the correct semantic HTML structure, including the nested <main>, <article>, and <aside> elements necessary for the Flexbox layout.new.css: Contains all the custom CSS and Flexbox rules required to achieve the layout goals, including the universal resets and final layout adjustments.üöÄ How to RunSave the HTML content as index.html.Save the CSS content as new.css in the same directory.Open index.html in any modern web browser to view the final layout.
